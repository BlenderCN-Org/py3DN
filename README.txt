Welcome!

Py3DN is an open-source solution providing innovative tools to analyze 3D data collected with the widely used commercial system Neurolucida (MBF). It allows the construction of mathematical representations of neuronal topology, visualization and a variety of morphometric analysis on the neuronal structures. Above all, it provides a flexible environment where new types of analyses can be easily set up allowing total freedom to test new hypotheses. The application was developed in Python and uses Blender (an open source program) to produce detailed 3D representations of raw and processed data.

Py3DN is described in the paper:
Aguiar P et al, "Versatile morphometric analysis and visualization of the three-dimensional structure of neurons", Neuroinformatics, 2013, 11(4):393-403
